# Understand JavaScript

A simple, clear, and complete guide to **understanding JavaScript**—not just writing code.

This is not just another tutorial.  
This is **the guide I wish I had** when I started (again).

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

I was tired of:
- Learning JavaScript over and over again.
- Forgetting concepts.
- Getting beaten by AI at writing and remembering code.

So, I decided to slow down.  
To **understand** JavaScript deeply.  
To build things, solve problems, and document my journey.

This repo is my **public journal**, but also a **complete resource** for anyone starting or restarting their journey in JavaScript.

Because:  
**Understanding → Better Thinking → Better Code → $$$**

And with AI by your side,  
👉 **You + AI + Concepts = 🔥**
